# News Website

A simple news website that fetches current trending news from various sources using GNEWS API and display them in a proper manner.

This website also uses OpenWeatherMap API to display the currrent and future weather conditions of a particular place.

I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for this project.
